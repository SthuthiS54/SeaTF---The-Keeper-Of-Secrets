# Challenge Description:
A high-security authentication system stores its access flag using a simple, yet effective encryption method. A leaked transmission has revealed the session key and the encrypted flag, but without the right approach, it's just a jumble of bytes.
Your task is to reverse-engineer the encryption scheme and retrieve the original flag.

# Hints:
Understanding byte-level manipulations will be essential for decryption.

The final flag follows the format SeaTF{...}.
